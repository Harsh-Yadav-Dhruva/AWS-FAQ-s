            <h4>What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it even easier for developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. Developers simply upload their application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>Will AWS Elastic Beanstalk support other languages?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Yes. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is designed so that it can be extended to support multiple development stacks and programming languages in the future. AWS is working with solution providers on the APIs and capabilities needed to create additional Elastic Beanstalk offerings.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>What can developers now do with AWS Elastic Beanstalk that they could not before?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk automates the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and application deployment, creating an environment that runs a version of your application. You can simply upload your deployable code (e.g., WAR file), and AWS Elastic Beanstalk does the rest. The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio and the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse allow you to deploy your application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and manage it without leaving your IDE. Once your application is running, Elastic Beanstalk automates management tasks–such as monitoring, application version deployment, a basic health check–and facilitates log file access. By using Elastic Beanstalk, developers can focus on developing their application and are freed from deployment-oriented tasks, such as provisioning servers, setting up load balancing, or managing scaling.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4> How is AWS Elastic Beanstalk different from existing application containers or platform-as-a-service solutions?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Most existing application containers or platform-as-a-service solutions, while reducing the amount of programming required, significantly diminish developers’ flexibility and control. Developers are forced to live with all the decisions predetermined by the vendor–with little to no opportunity to take back control over various parts of their application’s infrastructure. However, with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, developers retain full control over the AWS resources powering their application. If developers decide they want to manage some (or all) of the elements of their infrastructure, they can do so seamlessly by using Elastic Beanstalk’s management capabilities.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>What are the Cloud resources powering my AWS Elastic Beanstalk application?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk uses proven AWS features and services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, Amazon S3, and Amazon SNS, to create an environment that runs your application. The current version of AWS Elastic Beanstalk uses the Amazon Linux AMI or the Windows Server 2019.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>What kinds of applications are supported by AWS Elastic Beanstalk?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker, and is ideal for web applications. However, due to Elastic Beanstalk’s open architecture, non-web applications can also be deployed using Elastic Beanstalk. We expect to support additional application types and programming languages in the future. See Supported Platforms to learn more.</p>

            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk runs on the Amazon Linux AMI and the Windows Server AMI. Both AMIs are supported and maintained by Amazon Web Services and are designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for Amazon EC2 Cloud computing.</p>
